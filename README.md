# This is a project based on  Computer Vision. 
With python and libraries of OpenCV We can detect our hand gestures and use them to work on different ideas.
In this project we have used those to paint using our webcam. We can paint in the canvas of webcam and also draw circles using 3 fingers at a time. we can also erase what we draw on our screen. 
Further this could be used to highlight Powerpoint slides and online classes too.
